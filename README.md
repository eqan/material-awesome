## Material Awesome

### Original work by PapyElGringo, official development has moved to [material-shell](https://github.com/PapyElGringo/material-shell)

### 4) Clone the configuration

```
git clone https://github.com/eqan/material-awesome.git ~/.config/awesome
```

> Awesome 4.3 is so new that most of the distributions have not updated it yet. If you want to install this config on Awesome 4.2 (current version on depo) use the specific awesome-4.2 branch (not in development by me)

```
git clone -b awesome-4.2 https://github.com/PapyElGringo/material-awesome.git ~/.config/awesome
```

### 5) Set the themes

Start **lxappearance** to active the **icon** theme and **GTK** theme
Note: for cursor theme, edit `~/.icons/default/index.theme` and `~/.config/gtk3-0/settings.ini`, for the change to also show up in applications run as root, copy the 2 files over to their respective place in `/root`.

### 6) Same theme for Qt/KDE applications and GTK applications, and fix missing indicators

First install `qt5-style-plugins` or `qt5-style-gtk2` (debian) | `qt5-styleplugins` (arch) and add this to the bottom of your `/etc/environment`

```bash
XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Unity
QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2
```

The first variable fixes most indicators (especially electron based ones!), the second tells Qt and KDE applications to use your gtk2 theme set through lxappearance.

### 7) Read the documentation

The documentation live within the source code.

The project is split in functional directories and in each of them there is a readme where you can get additionnal informations about the them.

- [Configuration](./configuration) is about all the **settings** available
- [Layout](./layout) hold the **disposition** of all the widgets
- [Module](./module) contain all the **features** available
- [Theme](./theme) hold all the **aestetic** aspects
